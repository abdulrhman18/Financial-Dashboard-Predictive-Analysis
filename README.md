# 💼 Power BI Financial Dashboard – Revenue, Profit & What-If Simulation

This project is an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to provide business and financial insights through advanced DAX, drill-through capabilities, conditional formatting, and predictive What-If analysis.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

### 📌 Page 1: Revenue & Margin Analysis (2019)
This is the **main page** of the report and highlights three key KPIs:
- **Total Revenue**
- **Gross Margin**
- **Gross Margin Percentage (GM%)**

#### ✅ Key Features:
- **Conditional Formatting** on bar charts:
  - Bars turn **red** if the month's revenue or margin is **less than the previous month**, enabling quick trend detection.
- **Drill-through Functionality**:
  - Users can right-click to explore detailed pages for Revenue or Margin for deeper analysis.

### 📌 Page 2: Income Statement
A comprehensive view of the company's financial performance, including:
- **Sales**
- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**
- **Returns**
- **Operating Expenses**
- **Net Income**

The layout uses card visuals and breakdown charts to provide a full financial snapshot with interactivity.

### 📌 Page 3: What-If Scenario Analysis
This page features a **What-If simulation tool** built using Power BI parameters.  
#### Example Scenario:
> “What if the quantity sold changes by +20%?”

The model dynamically recalculates:
- Revenue
- Cost
- Gross Profit
- Net Income

This helps stakeholders simulate business scenarios and see real-time financial impact.
